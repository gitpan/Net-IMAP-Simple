Hi Paul,

sorry for the late reply. I was on vacation during pentecoast.

Yes, I can. I'll attach my test program and the debug log
to this mail.

Here is what I did:

lama:~>imap-simple-info sub/amavis
Warning: the returned message numbers are not always correct!
folder sub/amavis: 3798 total, 0 new, 3778 unseen, 3778 old

But the IMAP STATUS command says for this mail folder:
14 status sub/amavis (messages recent unseen)
* STATUS sub/amavis (MESSAGES 3798 RECENT 0 UNSEEN 3709)
14 OK Completed

And that's exactly what mutt says also: 3798 new, 3709 old

Thanks,
Andy.
