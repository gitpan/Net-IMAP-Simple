NAME
    Net::IMAP::Simple - Perl extension for simple IMAP account handling,
    mostly compatible with Net::POP3.

SYNOPSIS
        use Net::IMAP::Simple;

        # open a connection to the IMAP server
        $server = new Net::IMAP::Simple( 'someserver' );

        # login
        $server->login( 'someuser', 'somepassword' );
    
        # select the desired folder
        $number_of_messages = $server->select( 'somefolder' );

        # go through all the messages in the selected folder
        foreach $msg ( 1..$number_of_messages ) {

            if ( $server->seen( $msg ) {
                print "This message has been read before...\n"
            }

            # get the message, returned as a reference to an array of lines
            $lines = $server->get( $msg );

            # print it
            print @$lines;

            # get the message, returned as a temporary file handle
            $fh = $server->getfh( $msg );
            print <$fh>;
            close $fh;

        }

        # the list of all folders
        @folders = $server->mailboxes();

        # list all the folders given a path
        @folders = $server->mailboxes("Mail/");
    
        # list all folders given a path and mailbox name
        @folders = $server->mailboxes("Mail/" => "perl-*");

        # create a folder
        $server->create_mailbox( 'newfolder' );

        # rename a folder
        $server->rename_mailbox( 'newfolder', 'renamedfolder' );

        # delete a folder
        $server->delete_mailbox( 'renamedfolder' );

        # copy a message to another folder
        $server->copy( $self, $msg, 'renamedfolder' );

        # close the connection
        $server->quit();

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a simple way to access IMAP accounts. The API is mostly
    equivalent to the Net::POP3 one, with some aditional methods for mailbox
    handling.

BUGS
    I don't know how the module reacts to nested mailboxes.

    This module was only tested under the following servers:

    *   Netscape IMAP4rev1 Service 3.6

    *   MS Exchange 5.5.1960.6 IMAPrev1 (Thanks to Edward Chao)

    *   Cyrus IMAP Server v1.5.19 (Thanks to Edward Chao)

    Expect some problems with servers from other vendors (then again, if all
    of them are implementing the IMAP protocol, it should work - but we all
    know how it goes).
