   - documented see, unsee, add_flags, and sub_flags
   - used the IMAP RFC to show that gmail is wrong,
     Net::IMAP::Server is right.  google apps for domains
     apparently selects an unseen message willy nilly (or which
     ever is last) for the OK [UNSEEN #] message.  It should be
     the *first* unseen message.  Their IMAP is notoriously
     un-IMAP though.  I shouldn't be so surprised.
   - added undelete to go with the other flaggy functions
   - added more flag tests

1.1899_05: Tue Jun 16 06:42:16 EDT 2009
   - I started working on ticket 45953,
   - created sub_flags() and add_flags()
   - taught delete() to use add_flags() -- adds \Deleted
   - providing see() and unsee() for ticket 45953
   - I started building tests for the flag manipulation stuff and
     put reselect stuff ... noticed a possible bug in
     Net::IMAP::Server

1.1899_05: Sun Jun 14 07:14:54 EDT 2009
   - fixed t/test_server.pm (use IO::Socket::INET, not Net::TCP)

1.1899_04: Sat Jun 13 18:33:46 EDT 2009
   - added deleted() from JIK <jik@kamens.brookline.ma.us>'s
     patch.

1.1899_03: Sat Jun 13 17:05:55 EDT 2009
   - added a connection class so we might reject connections
     after the 4th, or whatever, and possibly solve ticket 30229
   - banged my head on the IO::Socket::SSL wall for a while
   - buu (#perl freenode) set me straight on something enabling
     me to close 30229.

1.1899_02: Sat Jun 13 07:39:29 EDT 2009
   - moved some tests around and fixed the manifests
   - added support, docs and test for EXAMINE

1.1899_01: Fri Jun 12 22:06:36 EDT 2009
   - man Coro is disaggreable in the shutdown epoch, it took a
     fork, a setsid and another fork to disssociate the test from
     the Coro ... um... messing with exit().
   - decided as I clear tickets from RT, I'll write tests.  As I
     write tests, I'll release dev releases, the *goal* will be
     1.1900 -- all RT cleared.

1.1900: Thu Jun 11 07:17:13 EDT 2009
   - fixed a bug I created in select
   - moved the tests around a little, getting ready for a whole
     suite

1.1900: Wed Jun 10 22:01:53 EDT 2009
   - It took me forever to figure out why the append command
     wouldn't work.  Bug submitted to Net::IMAP::Server
   - added my login function to contrib
   - I think I fixed the oldest bug on RT

1.1810: Sun Jun  7 10:52:30 EDT 2009
   - made $imap->select return "0E0" when 0 messages are found
     after an otherwise successful select.

1.1810: Sat Jun  6 22:13:34 EDT 2009
   - Started working on the tests.    Net::IMAP::Simple doesn't
     seem to be able to handle the results of a select command as
     returned by Net::IMAP::Server.  This may indicate other
     problems with protocol compliance.  I can't say definitley
     for sure that it's ::Simple, but that's the most likely
     suspect.

   - Made the module pull in IO::Socket::SSL without needing to
     involve another module that probably shouldn't be a whole
     separate distribution anyway.  Considering deprecating the
     Net::IMAP::Simple::SSL for that reason, and because that
     whole distribution is only 2 useful lines anyway.

1.1800: Thu Jun  4 21:44:59 EDT 2009
   - jettero started pulling in his changes.

1.15  2005-11-21
    - Added mailboxes_subscribed() function introduced by John
      Cappiello.  This function provides a method for retreiving
      a list of mailboxes which the user has subscribed to. This
      differs from the mailboxes() function in that with the
      mailboxes() function all mailboxes are returned, regardless
      ass to whether or not the user has subscribed to them.

1.14  2005-10-01
    - Fixed error in sample code within the POD documentation
      identified by Matthew S. Hallacy

      people are having with bug tracking and package management
      tools.

      Jonathan B. Glatt

    - Added current_box() function

      select() operations.

0.101 2005-01-06
    - Fixed bug which resulted in inconsistant results from
      login()

0.100 2005-14-05
    - Fixed dates in Changes file
    - Fixed IMAP protocol error identified by John A. Murphy
    - Changed behavior of login() to only return true or false.
      This change means that to get the current number of
      messages in a users INBOX folder you will need to preform a
      simple $imap->select("INBOX") after successfully logging
      in.
    - Added messages() function
    - Added the frame work within select() to provide more
      detailed information about the current IMAP framework
