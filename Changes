1.1912: Fri Apr 23 2010
   - Doug confirmed that it worked.  I'm going to go ahead and
     release this as a new version.

1.1912_1: Thu Apr 22 2010
   - Hrm, per Doug Reed at Service Optimi, I noticed that _last
     returns self->{last} regardless of whether it's ever been
     set.  Seems like we can DWIM and call self->select if it's
     never been called yet and make ->list (et al) function.

     We'll see what he thinks of this fix.

1.1911: Sun Mar 14 2010
   - Fixed [introduced] bugs illuminated in #55552 (RT), thanks
     to Aaron Wilson <aaron@gmx.co.uk> for a positively excellent
     bug report!

1.1910_2: Wed Feb 17 2010
   - http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2010/02/msg6764802.html
     - I still can't figure out what's causing this... NO IDEA
     - I made the test ridiculously verbose if two conditions are
       met: 1) automated testing; 2) the copy tests fail in some
       way.

1.1910_1: Sun Jan 17 2010
   - http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2010/01/msg6625605.html
     It seems the t/22_* tests are failing, but I can't seem to
     build a perl for which the tests fail. :(  No idea.
     I added another prereq to the makefile and added another
     line (perhaps informative?) to the t/22_copy* test.

1.1910: Tue Oct 27 2009
   - documented search() and added a bunch of kid functions that
     issue searches on your behalf.  Added tests for search().

1.1908: Thu Sep 24 2009
   - top() does a surprisingly terrible job at groking header
     lines.  If you have something like this:

       message-id:
            <blarg-blarg.blarg>

       date: wednesday, blarg blarg 
            xx:xx:xx (pdt)

     The results are somewhat random concerning, lines vs
     header-rows.  My goal is to make sure each element of the
     arrayref returned is a header line, not just a line of text.

1.1908: Sun Sep 20 2009
   - added a really weak search command.  I think we can do a
     little better...

1.1907: Sun Jul 26 2009
   - PREAUTH fix and tests
   - a nifty little contrib/ dovecot pipe server thingy
   - fixed serious issues with the greeting timeout

1.1905: Mon Jul 20 2009
   - I apparently need Class::Accessor installed for tests.
     Pulling over all deps of the now included net-imap-server

1.1904: Fri Jul 17 2009
   - bestpractical's patch makes more sense than mine does

1.1903: Fri Jul 17 2009
   - actually use the inc/ copy of net-imap-server

1.1902: Fri Jul 17 2009
   - I decided to include a static copy of net-imap-server so I
     know precisely what version is there for tests.  Suggested
     net-imap-server build tests using net-imap-simple this way.

1.1902: Thu Jul 16 2009
   - There's apparently 5.10 problems with the tests (probably
     not with the module).  The tests are kinda hinky anyway.

1.1900: Fri Jul 10 2009
   - I really thought I released this already.  Lawl.

1.1900: Fri Jun 26 16:03:16 EDT 2009
   - prolly going to release this, it seems to test fine all over
     the place.

1.1899_07: Sun Jun 21 07:16:36 EDT 2009
   - I decided to do get() my way, without ruining everything, by
     blessing the arrayref and overloading '""'.
   - I tought the t/35 test to prove that _process_command fails
     just as Jonathan Kamens says.
   - applied JIK's patch.

1.1899_07: Sat Jun 20 22:12:00 EDT 2009
   - I want to change the way get() works.  I don't think I
     should, but I'd like to return the actual message in scalar
     context and the lines in list context.  Returning the lines
     as an arrayref makes no sense to me.

1.1899_07: Sat Jun 20 15:26:13 EDT 2009
   - while trying to get some delete and copy tests I ended up
     working on expunge_mailbox() a little
   - found another bug in Net::IMAP::Server::Mailbox... It's
     clearly just a demo, but since I'm using it for my tests,
     it's worth fixing.
   - my delete tests do show that ranges like 3:5 really do work,
     which makes me think RT#40203 may turn out to be spurious.
     I'll let the tests prove it out before I close it though.
   - I refactored the _reselect() stuff away, it was poorly
     thought out.  There's a _clear_cache() instead.  Yeah, 40203
     appears to be bogus because the client doesn't really parse
     the sequence-set numbers.  I have confirmed for sure that
     you can $imap->delete("3:5,7,10") and it'll work just like
     you called delete 5 times.
   - Copies seem to work fine too.  I'm going to close the
     ticket.
   - Documented the sequence set stuff so RT#40203 doesn't come
     up again.

1.1899_06: Fri Jun 19 08:54:07 EDT 2009
   - added a status() sub for the STATUS command
   - added a status() test, with some unseen() flag tests
   - added a select() and current_mailbox() test -- failed to unescape
     the working mailbox for current_mailbox()
   - reported a status command bug (in Mailbox) to
     Net::IMAP::Server
   - moved a bunch of contrib and t7lib modules around to keep
     pause from indexing them.
   - worked on the docs for seen and unseen
   - created a method for error-checking when using msg_flags(),
     seen() and unseen() -- which I think solves ticket 33189.
     Basically, if Cyrus-imap is returning different values for
     FETCH (FLAGS) than for STATUS, what can I really do to fix
     it?  However, the log provided by Mr Spiegl seems to suggest
     he was counting errors as unseen messages... so this may
     just fix it.

1.1899_05: Wed Jun 17 06:25:39 EDT 2009
   - documented see, unsee, add_flags, and sub_flags
   - used the IMAP RFC to show that gmail is wrong,
     Net::IMAP::Server is right.  google apps for domains
     apparently selects an unseen message willy nilly (or which
     ever is last) for the OK [UNSEEN #] message.  It should be
     the *first* unseen message.  Their IMAP is notoriously
     un-IMAP though.  I shouldn't be so surprised.
   - added undelete to go with the other flaggy functions
   - added more flag tests

1.1899_05: Tue Jun 16 06:42:16 EDT 2009
   - I started working on ticket 45953,
   - created sub_flags() and add_flags()
   - taught delete() to use add_flags() -- adds \Deleted
   - providing see() and unsee() for ticket 45953
   - I started building tests for the flag manipulation stuff and
     put reselect stuff ... noticed a possible bug in
     Net::IMAP::Server

1.1899_05: Sun Jun 14 07:14:54 EDT 2009
   - fixed t/test_server.pm (use IO::Socket::INET, not Net::TCP)

1.1899_04: Sat Jun 13 18:33:46 EDT 2009
   - added deleted() from JIK <jik@kamens.brookline.ma.us>'s
     patch.

1.1899_03: Sat Jun 13 17:05:55 EDT 2009
   - added a connection class so we might reject connections
     after the 4th, or whatever, and possibly solve ticket 30229
   - banged my head on the IO::Socket::SSL wall for a while
   - buu (#perl freenode) set me straight on something enabling
     me to close 30229.

1.1899_02: Sat Jun 13 07:39:29 EDT 2009
   - moved some tests around and fixed the manifests
   - added support, docs and test for EXAMINE

1.1899_01: Fri Jun 12 22:06:36 EDT 2009
   - man Coro is disaggreable in the shutdown epoch, it took a
     fork, a setsid and another fork to disssociate the test from
     the Coro ... um... messing with exit().
   - decided as I clear tickets from RT, I'll write tests.  As I
     write tests, I'll release dev releases, the *goal* will be
     1.1900 -- all RT cleared.

1.1900: Thu Jun 11 07:17:13 EDT 2009
   - fixed a bug I created in select
   - moved the tests around a little, getting ready for a whole
     suite

1.1900: Wed Jun 10 22:01:53 EDT 2009
   - It took me forever to figure out why the append command
     wouldn't work.  Bug submitted to Net::IMAP::Server
   - added my login function to contrib
   - I think I fixed the oldest bug on RT

1.1810: Sun Jun  7 10:52:30 EDT 2009
   - made $imap->select return "0E0" when 0 messages are found
     after an otherwise successful select.

1.1810: Sat Jun  6 22:13:34 EDT 2009
   - Started working on the tests.    Net::IMAP::Simple doesn't
     seem to be able to handle the results of a select command as
     returned by Net::IMAP::Server.  This may indicate other
     problems with protocol compliance.  I can't say definitley
     for sure that it's ::Simple, but that's the most likely
     suspect.

   - Made the module pull in IO::Socket::SSL without needing to
     involve another module that probably shouldn't be a whole
     separate distribution anyway.  Considering deprecating the
     Net::IMAP::Simple::SSL for that reason, and because that
     whole distribution is only 2 useful lines anyway.

1.1800: Thu Jun  4 21:44:59 EDT 2009
   - jettero started pulling in his changes.

1.17  2006-10-11

      provided by Nate.  Nate also provided new release tests -
      thanks man.

1.15  2005-11-21
    - Added mailboxes_subscribed() function introduced by John
      Cappiello.  This function provides a method for retreiving
      a list of mailboxes which the user has subscribed to. This
      differs from the mailboxes() function in that with the
      mailboxes() function all mailboxes are returned, regardless
      ass to whether or not the user has subscribed to them.

1.14  2005-10-01
    - Fixed error in sample code within the POD documentation
      identified by Matthew S. Hallacy

1.13  2005-09-28
    - Versioning schema changed to use CVS versioning rather than
      hard coded versioning. This is to address issues some
      people are having with bug tracking and package management
      tools.

0.105 2005-09-28
    - Fixed syntax problem in the bindaddr option. Thanks
      Dagobert Michelsen for pointing this out.

0.104 2005-08-06
    - Fixed major bug discovered in get() and getfh() which
      caused message lines to be dropped if they started with an
      "*"

0.103 2005-07-10
    - Fixed error in select() identified by Guido Kerkewitz and
      Jonathan B. Glatt
    - Added folder_subscribe() and folder_unsubscribe() functions
      provided by Guido Kerkewitz.

0.102 2005-06-25
    - Fixed protocol error identified within the
      expunge_mailbox() function. (Thanks alot to William Faulk
      for pointing this out)
    - Fixed bugs in the sample imap.pl script provided.
    - Added flags() and recent() routines
    - Added current_box() function
    - Added use_select_cache and select_cache_ttl options. These
      options will allow you to enable internal caching for
      select() operations.

0.101 2005-01-06
    - Fixed bug which resulted in inconsistant results from
      login()

0.100 2005-14-05
    - Fixed dates in Changes file
    - Fixed IMAP protocol error identified by John A. Murphy
    - Changed behavior of login() to only return true or false.
      This change means that to get the current number of
      messages in a users INBOX folder you will need to preform a
      simple $imap->select("INBOX") after successfully logging
      in.
    - Added messages() function
    - Added the frame work within select() to provide more
      detailed information about the current IMAP framework

0.93  Thu Dec 16 16:15:00 1999
    - LIST ... {\d}\r\nmailbox parsing in mailboxes()
        - better escaping of \" e \\ (Netscape server doesn't put
          the \\ in the mailbox name. Why?)

0.92  Tue Dec 13 15:07:00 1999
    - seen method
        - \r\n as EOL. Thanks to Edward Chao!
